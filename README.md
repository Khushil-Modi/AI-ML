# AI-ML
In the first I done the perceptron programming and AND function as done in the lecture.
After that I tried various combinations of threshold values starting from 1 and found that the model needs minimum threshold value equals to 5 for predicted value.
Afer that I tried to change the learning rate starting from 0.01 to 10 crores. The only change I found was in the weights in the output received.
I have also displayed epoch numbers and random weights the model takes to learn and execute.
